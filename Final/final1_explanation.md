## Test Case Results

#### First Test Case
![First Test Case (123)](./final1_123.png)
In this test case, I inputted `123` into the console to see if it would print properly.
As the picture shows, you can see that it displays the correct numbers.
#### Second Test Case
![Second Test Case (aaa)](./final1_aaa.png)
In this test case, I inputted `aaa` into the console to see how it would handle characters.
As the picture shows, you can see that it turned the letters into numbers and didn't crash or anything like that.
Was this test case needed? Probably not but I wanted to see what would happen.
#### Third Test Case
![Third Test Case (!!!)](./final1_!!!.png)
Same thing with this test case, I wanted to see what would happen if I inputted `!!!` into the console.
All it did was change it to numbers just like the `aaa` test.
#### Fourth Test Case

And finally, in this test case I put in `999` to see if it would print properly, and it did. Woohoo.
